# Permutation-based Information Prevalence Inference using the i-th order statistic: i-pinpin

This is the MATLAB implementatation of the second-level statistical test for the decoding accuracy proposed by Hirose, 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1101/578930). The method is an extension of Permutation-based prevalence inference using the minimum statistic, proposed by Allefeld et al., (https://github.com/allefeld/prevalence-permutation/, Carsten Allefeld, Kai GÃ¶rgen and John-Dylan Haynes, 'Valid population inference for information-based imaging: From the second-level t-test to prevalence inference', NeuroImage 2016).
 i-pinpin provide a way to perform the group-level statistical test for informaiton-like measures, e.g. classification accuracy, Mahalanobis distance, similarity index etc.
